  <title>Poller changes</title>
  <description>Earlier this month we released some updates which enable alpha versions of InfluxDB and MIB-based polling.\nWe have some further updates planned for the near future which may affect polling, so if you are running a mission-critical LibreNMS instance, you may wish to consider disabling updates for the time being.\nIf you notice any issues, please get in touch with us via IRC or GitHub.</description>

  <title>NUT Ups Application monitoring update</title>
  <description>On December 20th we will be merging a PR that fixes the polling of data for NUT Ups devices.\n\nUnfortunately this will require users to delete the existing data and allow it to be re-created.\n\nTo do this, you can delete rrd files app-ups-nut-ID.rrd. ID will be a unique ID. After removing this file then data collection will start again.</description>
